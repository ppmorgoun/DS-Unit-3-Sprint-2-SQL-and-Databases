What is a situation where a document store (like MongoDB) is appropriate, and what is a situation where it is not appropriate?

MongoDB is a document-orientated database which provides a flexible semi-structured way to store and retrieve data. A great
example of when document-orientated databases are appropriate is in the case of big data, when large volumes of records are
being generated, of various data types and in various forms. Here a the type of databases structure MongoDB provides
excels as you can be flexible in the insertion of data without having to predefine a schema. A situation where these
sorts of databases are not appropriate could be in the case of a transactional ledger, where the data the use-case of
this databases begets a adherence to the ACID guidelines (atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability).


What is "NewSQL", and what is it trying to achieve?

NewSQL is a new paradigm of databases that attempts to provide the scalability of NO-SQL approaches (like MongaDB and
